        <h1>Online TAN Application</h1>
        <p>
            TAN or Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number is a 10 digit alpha numeric number required to be obtained by all persons who are responsible for deducting or collecting tax. Under Section 203A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is mandatory to quote Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN) allotted by the Income Tax Department (ITD) on all TDS returns.
<br><br>
            Since last few years ITD has revised the structure of TAN. It is a unique 10 digit alphanumeric code. Accordingly, they have issued TAN in this new format to all existing TAN holders.

        <h3 id="faq_q">FAQ:</h3>
        <ul id="faq">
            <li><span>What is TAN ?</span>
                TAN or Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number is a 10 digit alpha numeric number required to be obtained by all persons who are responsible for deducting or collecting tax. It is compulsory to quote TAN in all TDS/TCS returns (including e-TDS/TCS return), TDS/TCS payment challans and TDS/TCS certificates.            </li>
            <li><span>Who can apply for TAN ?</span>
                All existing assessees or taxpayers or persons who are required to file a return of income, even on behalf of others, must have a TAN. Any person, who intends to enter into economic or financial transactions where quoting TAN is mandatory, must also have a TAN.
            </li>
            <li><span>Why is it necessary to have TAN?</span>
                The provisions of Section 203A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 require all persons who deduct or collect tax at source to apply for the allotment of TAN. The section also makes it mandatory to quote TAN in all TDS/TCS/Annual Information Returns, payment challans and certificates to be issued. If TAN is not quoted, TDS/TCS returns will not be accepted by TIN-Faciliation Centres (TIN-FCs) and challans for TDS/TCS payments will not be accepted by banks. Failure to apply for TAN or not quoting the same in the specified documents attracts a penalty of Rs. 10,000.
            </li>
            <li><span>Who must apply for TAN?</span>
                All those persons who are required to deduct/collect tax at source on behalf of Income Tax Department are required to apply for and obtain TAN.
            </li>
            <li><span>What documents should be submitted alongwith the TAN application?</span>
                No documents are required to be submitted along with the application for allotment of TAN. However, where the application is being made online, the signed acknowledgment which is generated after filling up the form should be forwarded to NSDL. Detailed guidelines for submission of application are available on NSDL-TIN website.
            </li>
            <li><span>Is a separate TAN required to be obtained for the purpose of Tax Collection at Source (TCS)?</span>
                No. TAN which was allotted for Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) can be used for the purpose of TCS. However, if no TAN has been allotted, a duly filled in Form 49B, alongwith the application fees should be submitted at any TIN-FC.            </li>
            <li><span>How will the new TAN number be intimated to the applicant?</span>
                An allotment letter is dispatched by NSDL at the address provided in Form 49B.
            </li>
            <li><span> How can the change in address or details on the basis of which TAN was allotted be communicated to Income Tax Department?</span>
                Any change or corrections in the data associated with the TAN, should be communicated to ITD by filing up 'Form for Changes or Correction in TAN data for TAN allotted' alongwith the necessary fees at any of the TINFCs, or at NSDL-TIN website.
            </li>
            <li><span> If I change my address, should I inform ITD or should I apply for a new TAN?</span>
                Change of address within a jurisdiction does not change the TAN. However, it may involve a change in the Assessing Officer. Such changes must, therefore, be intimated to ITD so that the TAN database of ITD can be updated. In case of change of address from one jurisdiction to other (e.g. address changes from Bangalore to Mumbai) a new TAN needs to be applied for and previous TAN needs to be surrendered on allotment of fresh TAN.

            </li>
            <li><span>What is duplicate TAN?</span>
                Duplicate TAN is a TAN which has been inadvertently obtained by a person who is responsible for deducting/collecting tax and who already has a TAN allotted to him. It is illegal to possess or use more than one TAN. Different branches/divisions of an entity may, however, have separate TANs.
            </li>
            <li><span>Is it necessary to apply for different TAN if a deductor has to deduct tax from different types of payments like salary, interest, dividend etc.?</span>
                No. TAN once allotted can be used for all type of deductions/collections.
            </li>
            <li><span>Should Government deductors apply for TAN?</span>
                Yes. All Government deductors are also required to quote the TAN on their TDS / TCS / Annual Information Returns.
            </li>
            <li><span> In case of multiple DDOs, should all of them apply for TAN?</span>
                Yes. In such case, the name of the Division; name and location of branch or the designation of the person responsible for deducting/collecting tax, whichever is applicable, should be clearly given in the application for allotment of TAN.

            </li>
            <li><span>Can branches of companies/banks have separate TANs?</span>
                Yes. The name and location of branch or the designation of the person responsible for deducting/collecting tax, whichever is applicable, should be clearly given in the application for allotment of TAN.

            </li>
            <li><span>Can a TDS/TCS/Annual Information return be filed without TAN in case TAN has not been allotted?</span>
                Quoting of TAN is mandatory in all TDS/TCS/Annual Information returns, whether filed in paper or electronic format. The return, whether in paper or electronic format, will not be received in case correct TAN is not quoted.

            </li>
            <li><span>Can I quote PAN in place of TAN?</span>
                No. PAN should never be quoted in the field where TAN is required to be quoted. The purposes for which PAN and TAN are allotted are different. TAN is a unique identification number which is allotted to persons who are deducting or collecting tax at source on behalf of the Income Tax Department. PAN is a unique number allotted to assessees like individuals, companies etc.
